# Hello world 👋

Hey devs! I'm Patryk, a frontend developer from Poland, specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js. I build apps with a focus on simplicity and scalability.

Currently working on [eqchange.io](https://eqchange.io) – a hyperlocal platform for exchanging goods and services. Give away or trade what you don’t need for free! 🚀 {BETA soon}
